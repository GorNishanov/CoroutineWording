Editor's report for the Coroutines TS
===================================

## New papers

- N4649 is the current working draft. It replaces N4628.
- N4650 is this Editor's Report for the current working draft.

## Notable changes

Improved wording that allows implementations to omit copying of coroutine parameters. Now paragraph 11 of subclause 8.4.4 states that parameters are always copied and a new bullet in subclause [class.copy] allows to omit the copy if certain conditions are met. 

## Editorial changes

- Altered the Clauses 1-4 to conform to ISO guidelines
- Renamed section and subsections to Clauses and subclauses
- Inserted a missing function name in example 8.4.4/12
- Adjusted the date of the feature test macro to 201703

## Acknowledgments

We wish to thank all of the reviewers, including both the Core and Library Working groups.
