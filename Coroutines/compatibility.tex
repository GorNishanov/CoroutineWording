\rSec1[diff.iso]{\Cpp extensions for Concepts and ISO \Cpp 2014}

\pnum
This subclause lists the differences between \Cpp with Concepts
and ISO \Cpp, by the chapters of this document.

\rSec2[diff.lex]{Clause~\ref{lex}: lexical conventions}

\ref{lex.key}
\change New Keywords\\
New keywords are added to \Cpp extensions for resumable functions;
see \ref{lex.key}.
\rationale
These keywords were added in order to implement the semantics of the
new features. In particular, the \tcode{yield} keyword is added
to allow a function to yield zero or more values prior to completion. The \tcode{await} keyword is
added to enable a suspension of a resumable function while
awaiting on completion of asynchronous computation.
\effect
Change to semantics of well-defined feature.
Any ISO \Cpp programs that used any of these keywords as identifiers
are not valid \Cpp programs with resumable functions.
\difficulty
Syntactic transformation.
Converting one specific program is easy.
Converting a large collection
of related programs takes more work.
\howwide
Seldom.
