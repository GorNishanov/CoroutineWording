\pnum
This Technical Specification describes extensions to the C++ 
Programming Language (\ref{intro.refs}) that
enable definition of coroutines. These extensions include 
new syntactic forms and modifications to existing language semantics.

\pnum
The International Standard, ISO/IEC 14882, provides important context
and specification for this Technical Specification. This document is 
written as a set of changes against that specification. Instructions
to modify or add paragraphs are written as explicit instructions. 
Modifications made directly to existing text from the International
Standard use \added{underlining} to represent added text and
\removed{strikethrough} to represent deleted text. 
\cbstart \added{Changes to this technical specification relative to the previous revision are marked
	with change bars on the margin.} \cbend

%\pnum
%This revision updates N4499 with changes proposed in papers P0054 and P0070.

\rSec1[intro.refs]{Normative references}

\pnum
The following referenced document is indispensable for the
application of this document. For dated references, only the
edition cited applies. 

\begin{itemize}
\item ISO/IEC 14882:2014, \doccite{Programming Languages -- \Cpp}
\end{itemize}

ISO/IEC 14882:2014 is hereafter called the \defn{\Cpp Standard}.
%
Beginning with section 1.9 below, all clause and section numbers, titles,
and symbolic references in [brackets] refer to the corresponding elements of the \Cpp Standard. Sections 1.1 through 1.5 of this Technical
Specification are introductory material and are unrelated to the similarly-numbered sections of the \Cpp Standard.

% NOTES: N4302 use transaction memory edits to fix this. 

%\rSec1[intro.defs]{Terms and definitions}
%
%Add the definitions of ``suspend-resume-point'' and ``coroutine''.

%\setcounter{subsection}{26}
%\begin{quote}
%\indexdefn{suspend-resume-point}%
%\definition{suspend-resume-point}{defns.suspend.resume}
%A point in a \grammarterm{function-body}
%where evaluation of a function can be suspended
%with possibility of resuming it later
%via a call to a member function of a
%\tcode{coroutine_handle} object associated with the suspended function.
%\end{quote}
%
%\begin{quote}
%	\indexdefn{coroutine}%
%	\definition{coroutine}{defns.coroutine.function}
%	A function defined with \grammarterm{function-body} that
%	contains one or more suspend-resume-points.

Conformance requirements for this specification are the same as those 
defined in section 1.4 of the \Cpp Standard.

Conformance is defined
in terms of the behavior of programs.

\rSec1[intro.features]{Feature testing}

An implementation that provides support for this Technical Specification shall define the feature test macro in Table~\ref{tab:info.features}.

%\pnum
%The design of this specification is based, in part, on a concept 
%specification of the algorithms part of the C++ standard library, known 
%as ``The Palo Alto'' report (WG21 N3351), which was developed by a large 
%group of experts as a test of the expressive power of the idea of 
%concepts. Despite syntactic differences between the notation of the 
%Palo Alto report and this Technical Specification, the report can be seen as a 
%large-scale test of the expressiveness of this Technical Specification.

\pnum 
An instance of each object with automatic storage 
duration~(\cxxref{basic.stc.auto}) is associated with each entry into its 
block. Such an object exists and retains its last-stored value during 
the execution of the block and while the block is suspended (by a call 
of a function\added{, suspension of a coroutine (\ref{expr.await})}, 
or receipt of a signal).
