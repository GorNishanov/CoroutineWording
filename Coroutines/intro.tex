\pnum
This document describes extensions to the C++ 
Programming Language (Clause \ref{intro.refs}) that
enable definition of coroutines. These extensions include 
new syntactic forms and modifications to existing language semantics.

\pnum
The International Standard, ISO/IEC 14882:2017, provides important context
and specification for this document. This document is 
written as a set of changes against that specification. Instructions
to modify or add paragraphs are written as explicit instructions. 
Modifications made directly to existing text from the International
Standard use \added{underlining} to represent added text and
\removed{strikethrough} to represent deleted text.

%\pnum
%The design of this specification is based, in part, on a concept 
%specification of the algorithms part of the C++ standard library, known 
%as ``The Palo Alto'' report (WG21 N3351), which was developed by a large 
%group of experts as a test of the expressive power of the idea of 
%concepts. Despite syntactic differences between the notation of the 
%Palo Alto report and this document, the report can be seen as a 
%large-scale test of the expressiveness of this document.

\rSec1[intro.execution]{Program execution}
In subclause \cxxref{intro.execution} of the \Cpp Standard modify paragraph 6 to read:
\begin{quote}
\setcounter{Paras}{6}
\pnum 
An instance of each object with automatic storage 
duration~(\cxxref{basic.stc.auto}) is associated with each entry into its 
block. Such an object exists and retains its last-stored value during 
the execution of the block and while the block is suspended (by a call 
of a function\added{, suspension of a coroutine (\ref{expr.await})}, 
or receipt of a signal). 
\end{quote}

%\rSec1[lex]{Lexical conventions}
%
%In subclause \cxxref{lex.key} of the \Cpp Standard 
%add the keywords \tcode{co_await}, \tcode{co_yield}, and
%\tcode{co_return} to Table~4 "Keywords".
