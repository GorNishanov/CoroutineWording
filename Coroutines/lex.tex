\Sec1[lex.key]{Keywords}

\ednote{In Lenexa's EWG session there was a brief discussion on possible keywords. In this document we use placeholder keywords with suffix -keyword to be replaced with real ones in Kona. A companion paper discussing keyword alternatives is to appear in pre-Kona mailing. }

Add the keyword placeholders \tcode{await-keyword} and
\tcode{yield-keyword} to Table~4 "Keywords".
