\rSec1[over.oper]{Overloaded operators}

Add \tcode{co_await} to the list of operators in paragraph 1 before operators \tcode{()} and \tcode{[]}.

Add the following paragraph after paragraph 5.

\begin{quote}
\setcounter{Paras}{5}
\pnum
The 
\tcode{co_await} operator
is described completely in~\ref{expr.await}.
The attributes and restrictions
found in the rest of this subclause do not apply to it unless explicitly
stated in~\ref{expr.await}.

%If the operator is the operator

%the unary operator
%\tcode{\&},

%  When operator \tcode{co_await} returns, the \tcode{co_await} operator is applied to the value returned. The resulting \tcode{co_await} operator is assumed to be the built-in operator and interpreted according to Clause~\ref{expr}.

%\pnum
%If there is no user-declared \tcode{operator await} for type \tcode{X}, but there is a declared member with a name \tcode{await_suspend}, \tcode{await_ready}, or \tcode{await_resume}, then the implementation shall provide the implicit definition of \tcode{operator await} in such a way that the result of the evaluation of an implicit \tcode{operator await(\textit{v})} is \textit{v} itself.
