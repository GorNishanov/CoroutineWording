%\pnum
%If there is no user-declared \tcode{operator await} for type \tcode{X}, but there is a declared member with a name \tcode{await_suspend}, \tcode{await_ready}, or \tcode{await_resume}, then the implementation shall provide the implicit definition of \tcode{operator await} in such a way that the result of the evaluation of an implicit \tcode{operator await(\textit{v})} is \textit{v} itself.
